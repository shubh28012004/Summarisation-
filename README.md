NLP task summarization for hindi language

ROUGE-1: The model performs well with unigrams, achieving high recall (0.805) and precision (0.831), indicating strong performance in capturing individual words from the reference summaries.

ROUGE-2: The model shows reasonable performance with bigrams, achieving a slightly lower recall (0.729) and precision (0.737), which is expected since matching longer word sequences is more challenging.

ROUGE-L: The model demonstrates strong ability in capturing the longest common subsequence, with recall (0.785) and precision (0.808) scores similar to ROUGE-1, showing that it maintains the structural integrity of the summaries.

The results suggest the model is proficient in capturing individual words and the overall structure of the text, while it finds matching consecutive word pairs more challenging.
